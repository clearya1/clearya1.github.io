I am currently a PhD Student in the [School of Maths](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics) at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of [Dr. Jacob Page](https://www.jacob-page.com). Prior to this, I studied Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin, during which I was awarded the prestigious [Hamilton Prize](https://www.ria.ie/grants-awards/prizes/hamilton-prize-in-mathematics/) by the Royal Irish Academy and the [Laidlaw Scholarship](https://www.tcd.ie/Careers/students/awards/laidlaw/). Previously, I have also been a research intern at the Machine Learning Centre of Excellence in JP Morgan at the associate level, and at the Irish Centre for High End Computing.

Broadly speaking, I am interested in physically motivated machine learning, dynamical systems and fluid dynamics. Throughout my PhD, I have computed many dynamically invariant structures in chaotic systems such as the point vortex model and forced two-dimensional turbulence. Computationally, I have written differentiable flow solvers in JAX to enable gradient-based searches for these structures.
