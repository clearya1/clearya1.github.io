I am currently a postdoctoral fellow in the [Department of Mechanical Engineering](https://me.jhu.edu) at the Johns Hopkins University, under the supervision of [Prof. Tamer Zaki](https://engineering.jhu.edu/zaki/). Broadly speaking, I am interested in physically motivated machine learning, data assimilation and dynamical systems, with applications in fluid dynamics. 

Prior to this, I was a PhD Student in the [School of Maths](https://www.maths.ed.ac.uk/school-of-mathematics) at the University of Edinburgh, under the supervision of [Dr. Jacob Page](https://www.jacob-page.com). I studied Theoretical Physics at Trinity College Dublin, during which I was awarded the [Hamilton Prize](https://www.ria.ie/grants-awards/prizes/hamilton-prize-in-mathematics/) by the Royal Irish Academy and the [Laidlaw Scholarship](https://www.tcd.ie/Careers/students/awards/laidlaw/). I have also been a research intern at the Machine Learning Centre of Excellence in JP Morgan at the associate level, and at the Irish Centre for High End Computing.
